# Gaming Addiction Prevention System
A initiative called the Game Addiction Prevention System aims to assist users in recognizing and treating gaming addiction. The system offers feedback on the user's gaming addiction level and advises alternatives to gaming to cut down on time spent playing. The project uses ReactJS for the frontend and Python for the backend.
## Features
Addiction Level Assessment: Based on the user's gaming habits, including total gaming time, frequency of gaming sessions, and other relevant data, the system determines the user's level of addiction to gaming.
Adjustable Settings: Users can alter the system's suggested activities and addiction level threshold based on their own interests and requirements. Because of this, the system can be modified to meet the needs of different users.
User Dashboard: The system offers a straightforward dashboard where users may view their level of addiction, get ideas for activities, and monitor their development over time.
Alternative Activity Suggestions: Depending on the user's level of addiction, the system makes suggestions for alternative activities. Exercise, interaction with others, reading, and other pastimes can all be substituted for gaming as these activities.
